	"flow":"First the copper ore is transported into the primary crusher which reduces the ores to 8 inches or smaller. After crushing process, the copper ore is send to ball mill for grinding to about 0.2 mm with 3-inch steel balls. This copper ore slurry is finally pumped to the flotation deck. This copper ore slurry is finally pumped to the flotation deck with the fine sulfide ore (~-0.5 mm) going to froth flotation cells for recovery of copper."
