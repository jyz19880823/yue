	"flow":"After consulting with SBM engineer, they accepted our suggestion and add SBM VSI-7611 Sand Making Machine in the existing plant. This machine was to crush 20-35mm materials to 0-5mm; 5-10mm; 10-20mm directly. After commissioning, both the capacity and the final product quality exactly meet the quarry owner's initial plan."
