	"flow":"For most applications, clays are processed by mechanical methods, such as crushing, grinding, and screening, that do not appreciably alter the chemical or mineralogical properties of the material. However, because clays are used in such a wide range of applications, it is often necessary to use other mechanical and chemical processes, such as drying, calcining, bleaching, blunging, and extruding to prepare the material for use."
