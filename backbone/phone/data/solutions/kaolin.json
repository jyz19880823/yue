Dry process is mainly crushing the mined raw ore to around 25mm, then the ore goes into Cone Crusher for further crushing in order to make the size reach to around 6mm. The crushed ore will have a further grinding process by Raymond Mill which is equipped with centrifugal separator and cyclone dust extractor."
