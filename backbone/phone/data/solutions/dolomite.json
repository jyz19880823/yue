After first step, the material will transferred to Impact Crusher by Belt Conveyor for secondary crushing. The crushed dolomite materials will be transferred to Vibrating Screen for separating. After separating, the parts that can meet standard will be transferred away as final products, while the other parts will be returned to impact crusher."
