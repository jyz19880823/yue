		"recycle":"type:material, introduction:SBM crushing machine are usually used to crush concrete, glass, porcelain, marble, granite, bricks, blocks, asphalt and reinforced concrete. Recycling concrete &building rubble is not only able to bring profit to investors, but also good for environment protection., flow:Construction wastes are firstly be transported to the crushing plant by trucks or by excavators. Then Jaw Crusher crush big lumps to small ones. When the crushed lumps discharged from jaw crusher, the secondary crusher will crush them again until they meet the requirements.",
		"river":"type:material, introduction:River stones are mainly river red stones or materials. River stone crushing plant is the major crushing unit to process river stones like cobble rocks, pebble, sand & gravel, silica etc. It calls for crushing, screening and washing process., flow:At the plant, raw river stone will be fed into Jaw Crusher for primary crushing by Vibrating Feeder. Then, the material will be transferred to Impact Crusher for secondary crushing. Then the screening process will begin. The vibrating screen is a key equipment to sieve the crushed stones into different grades. The crushed stone meet the demands will be transported to the stockpile, the other will be sent to cone crusher or impact crusher for fineness crushing.",
		"sand":"type:material, introduction:Sand is widely used in road construction, real estate development, concrete making etc. With the rapid development of construction industry, the amount of the natural sand failed to keep pace with the various sectors of modern world development needs., flow:The raw material is transferred to jaw crusher for primary crushing by vibrating feeder, then the crushed materials whose size is larger than 40 mm are transferred to VSI crusher through belt conveyor for secondary crushing. The materials crushed will be transferred to the vibrating screen. The materials with suitable size will be transferred to VSI crusher, after being washed by sand washers, then clean final products will be discharged.",
		"silica":"type:material, introduction:Silica is the most abundant mineral found in the crust of the earth. With local teams of application engineers and technology specialists, SBM is dedicated to supporting its technology and providing the design-in expertise for customers to compete successfully., flow:In the silica powder making process, Jaw Crusher is used as primary crushing machine.The sand particles that meet the requirements enter into the VSI Sand Making Machine for making fine sand, while the others enter into the tertiary crushing plant for fine crushing, then go for sand making. The fine sand from the sand making machine must be washed by sand washer. Then we need silica sand milling machine, it can grind silica sand into powder.",
		"silver":"type:material, introduction:Silver is a soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it has the highest electrical conductivity of any element and the highest thermal conductivity of any metal. SBM crushers have a very important role in silver ores mining, especially in silver ores’ crushing process., flow:Silver is commonly extracted from ore by crushing, grinding, smelting or chemical leaching. Jaw Crusher is commonly used as the primary crusher and Impact Crusher, Cone Crusher are used as secondary crusher. The Ball Mill, Raymond Mill or High Pressure Mill is often used as grinding machine to grind silver ores to final size. The crushed silver ores will be smelted to get the final product – silver.",
		"sirilanka":"type:project, introduction:The customer started contact with SBM in 2011 and said they would like to set up a granite crushing plant in Sri Lanka in 2011 urgently.brRaw material: granitebrMax. Feeding size: 500-600mmbrOutput size: 0-6mm,6-12mm,12-19mm,19-37.5mmbrCapacity: 120-150tph, flow:As per their specification requirements and the original unflat ground drawings, we designed a perfect flow chart to meet their request very well. SBM sent out one or two engineers to their work site to help them installing, commissioning as well as training their employees how to operate and so on. Nowadays the crushing plant is working very well.",
		"talc":"type:material, introduction:Talc is a common metamorphic mineral in metamorphic belts which contain ultramafic rocks. Talc powder is widely used in agriculture and food, ceramics, coating, paper, personal care, plastic, rubber, wastewater treatment industries., flow:Talc rock is mined by giant shovels. The different ore types are sorted as they are extracted from the seam. The large talc rocks will be fed into crushing plant for small particles. Then the talc ores will be sorted according to their talc content and brightness. From talc rock to talc powder, the talc processing plant involves crushing, washing, sorting, analysis, milling (grinding, pulverizing) and packing etc.",
		"uae":"type:project, introduction:A quarry operator in the UAE needed to expand their crushing and screening plant. Though they already have one primary and a secondary crusher, material comes out from the secondary crusher are mostly above 20mm. While, the new demand of customers is 0-5mm; 5-10mm; 10-20mm, the existing plants can not meet the newest requirements well. , flow:After consulting with SBM engineer, they accepted our suggestion and add SBM VSI-7611 Sand Making Machine in the existing plant. This machine was to crush 20-35mm materials to 0-5mm; 5-10mm; 10-20mm directly. After commissioning, both the capacity and the final product quality exactly meet the quarry owners initial plan."
